## About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with 5 years of experience shipping back-end heavy, data-intensive products that run fast and scale smoothly. My track record includes cutting latency, slashing infrastructure costs, and rolling out features that drive user growth.

### What I Do

I specialize in building robust backend systems using a variety of technologies:

- **Languages**: Ruby (on Rails), Go (Echo, Fiber), PHP (Laravel)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS, CI/CD pipelines
- **Methodologies**: TDD, Clean Architecture, Metrics-driven development

### My Philosophy

I believe in writing code that not only works but is maintainable, testable, and performant. I'm passionate about:

- **Clean Architecture**: Building systems that are easy to understand and modify
- **Performance Optimization**: Creating software that runs efficiently at scale
- **Test-Driven Development**: Ensuring reliability through comprehensive testing
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with industry best practices

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer community through writing and mentoring.

Let's build something amazing together!
